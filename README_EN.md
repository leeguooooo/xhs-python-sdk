## üõ† Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+ (for signature generation)

### Install from PyPI (Coming Soon)
```bash
pip install xhs-sdk
```

### Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leeguooooo/xhs-python-sdk.git
cd xhs-python-sdk
pip install -e .
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Authentication
First, obtain your cookie from XiaoHongShu web:
1. Visit https://www.xiaohongshu.com and log in
2. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab
3. Refresh the page, find any request, copy the `Cookie` header value

### Basic Usage

```python
from xhs_sdk import XhsClient
from xhs_sdk.exceptions import XhsAuthError

# Initialize client
client = XhsClient(cookie="your_cookie_here")

try:
    # Get current user info
    user = client.get_current_user()
    print(f"User: {user.nickname} (ID: {user.user_id})")
    
    # Search notes
    notes = client.search_notes("Python programming", limit=10)
    for note in notes:
        print(f"- {note.title} ({note.likes} likes)")
        
except XhsAuthError:
    print("Authentication failed. Please update your cookie.")
```

### Async Support

```python
import asyncio
from xhs_sdk import AsyncXhsClient

async def main():
    async with AsyncXhsClient(cookie="your_cookie") as client:
        # Concurrent requests
        user, notes = await asyncio.gather(
            client.get_current_user(),
            client.search_notes("programming")
        )
        print(f"{user.nickname} found {len(notes)} notes")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## üìñ API Reference

### Client Configuration

```python
client = XhsClient(
    cookie: str,              # Required: authentication cookie
    timeout: int = 30,        # Request timeout in seconds
    max_retries: int = 3,     # Maximum retry attempts
    retry_delay: float = 1.0, # Delay between retries
    debug: bool = False,      # Enable debug logging
    proxy: dict = None        # HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings
)
```

### Error Handling

```python
from xhs_sdk.exceptions import (
    XhsAuthError,      # Authentication errors
    XhsAPIError,       # API errors
    XhsNetworkError,   # Network errors

        cursor=cursor
    )
    all_comments.extend(page.comments)
    
    if not page.has_more:
        break
    cursor = page.cursor
    
print(f"Total comments: {len(all_comments)}")
```

### Batch Operations (Async)

```python
async def batch_search():
    async with AsyncXhsClient(cookie="cookie") as client:
        keywords = ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Data Science"]
        
        # Concurrent searches
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[
            client.search_notes(kw, limit=5) 
            for kw in keywords
        ])
        
        for keyword, notes in zip(keywords, results):
            print(f"{keyword}: {len(notes)} notes")
```
